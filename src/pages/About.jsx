            Iâ€™m a developer passionate about crafting accessible, pixel-perfect
            user interfaces that blend thoughtful design with robust
            engineering. My favorite work lies at the intersection of design and
            development, creating experiences that not only look great but are
            meticulously built for performance and usability.

            Currently, I'm looking for job opportunities where I can contribute
            to innovative projects, grow my skills as a developer, and
            collaborate with a dynamic team to build impactful solutions.

            In my spare time, I enjoy playing cricket, gaming, spending quality
            time with friends, or staying active at the gym. These activities
            help me unwind and stay energized.
